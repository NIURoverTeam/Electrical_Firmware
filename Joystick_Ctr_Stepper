Programmer:
Alejandro Arreguin

Purpose of this code:
To control a stepper motor with a joystick for testing purposes.

Notes:
By no means is this code efficient nor is it meant to be
as this code was made for testing purposes only. Although
if it were to be applied to a final design,
some code can be rewritten to make it better.
For better understanding of the Arduino language please reference:

if you are not familiar with it yet, or need a refresher( i sure did haha! ).
